These are just the ramblings of a madman, for future implementation. The current version of the randomizer has no logic except
1. nail, boringBook, newLamp, deadMansCoin, and the 4 shop counter items are unshuffled
2. map is always in one of the 6 locations that requires no other items (actually 5, since one of those is the boringBook).
Game will sometimes be beatable but not always. Map and book let you check a lot of places, though, so the odds are not too bad.

Acts:
Trading ring for map from the merchant enters act 2
Passing gnomes enters act 3
Rescuing Celeste from the Minotaur enters act 4
Lifting Beast's curse enters act 5

In the vanilla game (by skipping the gnomes) and in randomizer, it is possible to do these events in a different order. No matter what order you do the events in, the acts will always go 1 2 3 4 5. For example, if you get the map to go to act 2, and then rescue Celeste from the Minotaur, you will enter act 3, not act 4. Going back to the gnomes at this time would enter act 4 (although I haven't tested that the gnomes stick around).

Most things don't care about the current act, but some do. For example, the new items that spawn in the garden on the Isle of Wonder are controlled by the current act. I need to do a little more research to work out all of the act logic.

nail 26 880 64 (no owner by default in vanilla. It becomes 880 when the picture is removed from the wall) 26 (not randomized for now, due to 1. weird owner behavior 2. it's logically just a duplicate of skeleton key and 3. the location is short path only anyway. A duplicate skeleton key would be nice, though.)

Item temporary or permanent loss of access (items that are no longer useful not included, but those matter for pawn shop):
If you have an item checked out from the shopkeeper and lose it, you can no longer access the rest (unless MAYBE if you reobtain the coins; not sure. Better test)
map can be traded for ring and possibly pearl. But there's no way to lose those items, and they're given to the shopkeeper by the player (not random), so the map can always be retrieved.
Trading ring to singsing makes it not retrievable, locking the map and ink locations if you haven't already gotten them.
Burn Beauty's dress (locks out of short path; nbd)
iceberg  can melt (but I think it's always possible to get it to the pond before it does. Where is the farthest location from the pond? probably catacombs. Maybe it should be excluded from there if you don't know cataclypse... but maybe it's fine. test it)

Locations:
    Isle of the Crown:
	    requires: none
		locations:
		    beach 1 & beach 2
			mint (requires act 1 or 2)
			ferry cabin
			lamp (requires hunters lamp, act 1 or 5, and you have to be done with the rain spell if you want to keep access to the embers (and thus the underworld and thus the river styx and thus the long path castle))
	Merchant trades
	    requires: none
		locations:
		    map & ink (requires ring. May change ring location to require map instead, but for now it cares about whether you have the item that replaced the map.
            If you're not in act 1 and you got rid of the item that replaced the map, you may be able to trade ring for map replacement instead of for pearl. Not sure)
			ring retrade (requires pearl. You can also trade back the item that replaced the map, if desired).
			4 objects (requires coin. this logic is a complicated special case, since you can only carry 1 at a time, and if you lose it you're locked out of the others)
		nonlocations:
		    reanimation
	Singsing
	    requires:
		    map
			nightingale
		locations:
		    ribbon (requires ring, and if you have to do this check to get pearl then there's no way to check ink + map locations (which may be fine, depending on settings))
			note (requires poem and ring)
		nonlocations: 
		    sending a rose
	Sacred Mountain:
	    requires:
		    map
		locations:

		    map
		locations:
		    shield (need to check sacred water to get out)
			coins (need to check sacred water to get out)

			sacred water (requires dagger + only accessible from dagger location)
	Isle of Wonder
	    requires:
		    map
		locations:
		    sentence
			pearl (requires boring book)
	Isle of Wonder inside:
	    requires (easy logic only, except... can you gnome skip to the right?):
		    nightingale
			rabbit's foot
			flower
			invisible ink
			mint (not peppermint)
		locations:
		    book of riddles (requires dangling participle)
			milk
			teacup (requires book of riddles traded to shopkeeper)

			baby's tears (requires spellbook and hunter's lamp. Lamp is weird special case)
			hole in the wall (requires flute)

	Isle of the Beast:
	    requires:
		    map
		locations
		    participle (requires sentence)
			lamp (requires )
			rose (requires shield and either  or (ring and rose)) (reobtainable)
			beast's ring (requires  shield and scythe, plus ring + rose to get out of beast mode) (see notes)
				1. I'm not 100% clear on this but I think the timer activates when getting the item from the beast, but the script egoBeastScript that is called when the timer expires, turning you into a beast, is attached to the ring. This doesn't match the lore, so ideally the randomizer will attach the script to the other item... but it could be destroyed? So it should go on ego (but then disabled somehow)? Maybe it still works if the script is on the ring, even if the ring is not held by Alexander, which would mean no action required? idk. Needs testing
				2. if you get ring and rose early in the game, you can teleport straight to the beast's garden. hedges + shield work from the back so that's fine (beast ring check is now inaccessible, so logic has to consider that. rose still needs shield to access). Lettuce does not work from the back (could either change alexander's target or change the lethality of the pond in that case, or player can just just use lettuce from the front and then teleport in), but the pond can be skipped with the boring book
			dress + mirror (requires lettuce, shield, scythe, rose, ring)
	Druid island
	    requires:
            oracle visited
            map (required to visit oracle anyway)
			act < 5 or all items needed to cast rain (lamp, tears, falling water, sacred water, spellbook)
        locations:
		    coal
			scythe
	Land of the dead:
	    requires:
		    spellbook
			skull
			hair (either)
			egg
			embers (which is theoretically not randomized, but you need to cast rain for it? Like the lamp this is a weird special case of a container changing state)
			dead coins (to get out)
			mirror (to get out)
			ticket (to get out)
		locations:
		    ticket
		    key
			handkerchief
			gauntlet (requires ticket)
			progressive teacup
	Hair:
	    1 check from ribbon and one from dress. You can only check one, and you must check the one that you first checked the vanilla location for (e.g. if you checked the ribbon location first, you can no longer check for the item contained within the clothes).
	Short Castle:
	    requires:
		    dress
			nightingale (to get out)
			letter (to get out)
			dagger (to get out)
			mirror (to get out)
			mint or peppermint (to get out) (NOTE could also shuffle the REAL lamp into the pool, instead of the replica. Then it would also be usable in the short path)
		locations:
		    nail (requires nail to put back, I guess? Or do you put the same item back? But if the location doesn't contain a nail or skeletonKey to begin with, there's no reason to grab it at all)
			letter (requires nail or skeletonKey)
			sword (randomizing this would be meaningless and maybe difficult to code)
	Long Castle:
	    requires:
		    cup of swamp ooze and river styx water (third container special case)
			mirror OR Cassima's parents saved (in this version, as in vanilla, you cannot have the paint and the mirror)
			spellbook
			feather
			brush
			handkerchief
			dagger (to get out)
			letter (to get out)
			correct lamp or mint or peppermint (to get out)
		locations:
		    letter (requires skeletonKey or nail) (unsure if putting the dagger here is valid or not; do you have time to backtrack?)
	
Hard Logic option:
    getting past gnomes has no requirements (you always have the map when you get there)
	catacombs checks only require an object to activate cataclypse, like the boring book (what else works?), and the red scarf for the last check (meaning it is allowed to be placed inside the dungeon).

Spells are weird because they're not all items, and they need to go in a certain order. also, you need the spellbook to spawn some stuff, but not other stuff:
    For nightmare:
	    skull, embers (not an item), then egg + hair
	For paint:
	    teacup, swamp ooze (not an item), then river styx (not an item), then feather
	For rain:
	    lamp, tears (not an item) + sacred waters, then falling water (not an item)

Timers:
    embers (will not be shuffled this version so no code changes required)
	lettuce (logic probably can ignore the timer unless it's in a 1 way)
	beast (may just work: need to test. Although if it's broken it's no big deal)
